==Purpose==

The Price viewpoint enables to simply describe the non-functional aspect of price in Capella.

==Scope==

Price information can be added on a Physical Component or graphically in PAB diagrams.

==Principles==

On a Physical Component, a 'Price' indicator defines the price associated to a Component. A "Maximal Price" defines the upper price accepted by a component.

When a component contains sub-components, recursively, the total price is the sum of the price of its sub-components and its price.

Graphically, when:

* Total price < Maximal Price: the Physical Component and associated annotation are displayed in '''green'''.
* Total price = Maximal Price: the Physical Component and associated annotation are displayed in '''orange'''.
* Total price > Maximal Price: the Physical Component and associated annotation are displayed in '''red'''.

==Practice==
The Basic Price viewpoint enriches the Capella palette with a new section composed of one icon:
* '''Price''': it enables to set the price of a Physical Component Node or Behavioral Component.


Use of Price:
* Click on the icon and next on a Physical Component Node or Behavioral Component.
* Set the current Value and Max Value in the 'Basic Price' section of the Properties view.
* The Price of the components containing the current component are automatically recomputed and the colors change if needed.


A Price can be alone on the current diagram. That means that this Price is applied on the Physical Component which contains the diagram (e.g., the Physical System).
