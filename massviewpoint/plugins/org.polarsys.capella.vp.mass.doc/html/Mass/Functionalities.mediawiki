==Purpose==

The Mass viewpoint enables to simply describe the non-functional aspect of mass in Capella.

==Scope==

Mass information can be added on a Physical Component or graphically in PAB diagrams.

==Principles==

On a Physical Component, a "Mass" annotation indicates the mass associated to a component. A "Maximal Mass" defines the upper mass accepted by a component.

When a component contains sub-components, recursively, the total mass is the sum of the mass of its sub-components and its mass.

Graphically, when:

* Total mass < Maximal Mass: the Physical Component and associated annotation are displayed in '''green'''.
* Total mass = Maximal Mass: the Physical Component and associated annotation are displayed in '''orange'''.
* Total mass > Maximal Mass: the Physical Component and associated annotation are displayed in '''red'''.

==Practice==

The Basic Mass viewpoint enriches the Capella palette with a new section composed of one icon:
* '''Mass''': it enables to set the mass of a Physical Component Node or Behavioral Component.

Use of Mass:
* Click on the icon and next on a Physical Component Node or Behavioral Component.
* Set the current Value and Max Value in the 'Basic Mass' section of the Properties view.
* The mass of the components containing the current component are automatically recomputed and the colors change if needed.

A Mass can be alone on the current diagram. That means that this Mass is applied on the Physical Component which contains the diagram (e.g., the Physical System).
