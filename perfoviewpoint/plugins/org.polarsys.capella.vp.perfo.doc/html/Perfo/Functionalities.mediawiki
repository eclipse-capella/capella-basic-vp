==Purpose==

The Performance viewpoint enables to simply describe the non-functional aspect of performance in Capella.

==Scope==

Performance information can be added on a Logical/PhysicalFunction, Logical/PhysicalFunctionExchange, and Logical/PhysicalFunctionalChain elements or graphically in LAB/PAB diagrams.

==Principles==

On a Functional Exchange or Function, an "Execution Time" indicator defines the execution time. A "Time Limit" defines the maximal execution accepted by a Functional Chain.

The Total Execution Time of a Functional Chain is the sum of the Execution Time of all the Functional Exchange and Function elements which compose the Functional Chain.

Graphically, when:

* Total Execution Time < Execution Limit: the Execution Limit is displayed in '''green'''.
* Total Execution Time = Execution Limit: the Execution Limit is displayed in '''orange'''.
* Total Execution Time > Execution Limit: the Execution Limit is displayed in '''red'''.

==Practice==
The Basic Performance viewpoint enriches the Capella palette with a new section composed of two icons:
* '''Function Time Consumption''': it enables to state a level of time consumption of a Function or Functional Exchange.
* '''Functional Chain Consumption''' it enables to state the maximum level of time consumption accepted by a Functional Chain.


Use of Function Time Consumption:
* Click on the icon and next on a Function or Functional Exchange.
* Set the execution time accessible in the 'Basic Performance' section of the Properties view.
* The Functional Chain Consumption is automatically recomputed and the color changes if needed.


Use of Functional Chain Consumption:
* Click on the icon and next on a functional chain.
* Set the Execution Time Limit accessible in the 'Basic Performance' section of the Properties view.
* The Functional Chain Consumption is automatically recomputed and the color changes if needed.
